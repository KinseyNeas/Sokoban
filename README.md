## HW3: Sokoban Assignment

### Goal

The goal of this game is to push the all of the pool tubes on top of the designated stars.

### Game Mechanics
Move the character using *WASD* or the *up, down, left,* and *right* arrow keys.

You and the pool tubes can't move through the fence.

You can push the pool tubes.

If you need to *reset* the level or return to the *main menu*, press the pause button in the top right corner.

### Additional Features 
#### *(included outside of minimum required elements)*

I hand drew custom sprites for the assignment *(including: alligator, stars, pool tube, grass, and fence)*.

I created a *pause panel* that would let you return to the main menu.

I created an *in-between-levels panel* that lets you move forward and backwards between levels as well as reset the level or return to the main menu. 

I utilized animated tiles in one of my tilemaps.
